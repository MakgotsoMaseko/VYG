        <h1>VYG Projects</h1>
        <p>The VYG projects exist to uplift, empower, and transform the lives of young people across South Africa. Each project is uniquely designed to meet specific needs, whether itâ€™s emotional support, spiritual guidance, community outreach, or talent development. From helping those battling self-harm and bullying through the Help Project, to reigniting faith through the Archangels Project, to building technical skills in the Media Project, VYG ensures that every young person has a place to belong, grow, and lead. These projects work together to form a strong foundation of purpose, vision, and unity.</p>
